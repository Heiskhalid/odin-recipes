        <h4>Dish Description</h4>

        <p>
            This is a completely unpretentious, down-home macaroni and cheese recipe just like my grandma and mom always
            made. A simple white sauce where you add cheese and a few other flavors with macaroni and a potato chip
            crust. This recipe makes a lot, I like to make two pans so I can take one to a pot luck and have the other
            one to keep in the fridge for later. It's an easy recipe to adjust down if you only want to make one pan. If
            you aren't cooking it right away, just keep the topping separate until you are ready to put it in the oven.

            <h4>Directions</h4>

            <ol type="a">
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong>

                    <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Step 2</strong>

                    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                        Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
                        stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                    <p>
                        Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking
                        constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes.
                        Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45
                        seconds; repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir
                        Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season
                        with salt and black pepper.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li><strong>Step 4</strong>

                    <P>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10
                        minutes.
                        Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts
                        completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about
                        4
                        ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.
                    </P>

                </li>


                <!--STEP 5 -->
                <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
                    <p>
                        Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch
                        baking dishes.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Step 6</strong>
                    <p>
                        Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the
                        macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.


                    </p>
                </li>



                <li><strong>Step 7</strong>
                    <p>
                        Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45
                        minutes.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
